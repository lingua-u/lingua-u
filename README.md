## Welcome to Lingua-U and Jai'ai ðŸ‘‹

Lingua-U is a philosophical spiritual constructed metalanguage (or spiritual metalang) based on the ancient Chinese classic Tai Hsuan Ching. It was created by the American author Joe Perez for the purpose of synthesizing the insights of the world's Sacred Word traditions with contemporary phonosemantic research. Early versions of the metalanguage were published privately to small audiences in 2010 as *The Lingua-U White Paper*, and in 2016 as *Lingua-U: The Unitive Metalanguage*, and will be presented in mature form in 2022 as *Lingua-U: The Unitive Metalanguage*. The metalanguage is known for composing all words and phrases with only three fundamental characters, known as the Principles of yang, yin, and yung.

And then there is Jai'ai, a philosophical spiritual constructged language (or spiritual conlang) based on Lingua-U. It was also created by Joe Perez and will be launched at the same time as Lingua-U or subsequently. It supplies a spoken and written language for the purposes of developing a more integral and holistic relationship to the energy of acred Words.
